Hint:
If we changed <code>Foo</code> from a <code>struct</code> to a <code>class</code>, the output of the program would change.

Explanation:
This question highlights a feature of C# called <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/avoiding-struct-and-readonly-reference-performance-pitfalls-with-errorprone-net/">defensive copy</a>, which ensures that mutations on value types referenced through read-only variables have no effect on the original value. 

In the function <code>Bar</code>, when we use <code>Set()</code> to mutate the input struct, a hidden copy of the struct is made, and this copy is what is mutated. Thus the first <code>Console.Write</code> prints 0. In the second case, this copy does not occur as the input is not read-only, so we print 1.

If <code>Foo</code> had been a reference type (a class) instead of a value type (a struct), this program would have printed "11".
