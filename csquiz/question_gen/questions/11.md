Hint:
If we changed all <code>struct</code>s in the code to <code>class</code>es, the output of the program would change.

Explanation:
This question highlights a feature of C# called <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/avoiding-struct-and-readonly-reference-performance-pitfalls-with-errorprone-net/">defensive copy</a>, which ensures that mutations on value types referenced through read-only variables have no effect on the original value. 

For the objects <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>d</code>, defensive copy has no effect, as we either have a reference type (a class) or a mutable value type field (a struct), so we print "12".

However, for the object <code>a</code> defensive copy kicks in, as we are trying to mutate a read-only value type field. Thus, both evaluations of <code>a.Increment</code> make a copy of the original struct and mutate this copy. The result is printing "11".

In all cases, the original structs are zero-initialized.
