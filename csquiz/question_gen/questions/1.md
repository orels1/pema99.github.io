Hint:
Resolution of overloaded extension methods is done entirely at compile time.

Explanation:
<code>FooExt</code> defines 2 overloaded extension methods on <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code>. The question is about which overload is chosen in 2 different cases. Extension method overloads are resolved entirely at compile time, and the resolution algorithm always prefers the overload with the most concrete/specific type. 

In the first case, we know at compile time that we have <code>Foo&lt;int&gt;</code>. <code>Foo&lt;int&gt;</code> is more specific than <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code>, so we pick that corresponding overload.

In the second case, looking at the body of <code>Baz</code>, the only information the function has at compile time is that the input is of type <code>Foo&lt;T&gt;</code>, so there is only one possible choice of overload. In C#, generics are a feature of the runtime - they are not monomorphized.
