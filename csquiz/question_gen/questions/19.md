Hint:
When exactly are static fields initialized?

Explanation:
If none of the static fields in a type are used, no static field initializer will be executed for that type. We do use <code>Program</code> on the first line of <code>Main</code>, but we never refer to any static fields, so the program prints "1". If we had written something like <code>baz = baz;</code>, the program would print "2".
