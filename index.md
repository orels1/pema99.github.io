title: Hey there!

I'm Pema. I write code - sometimes. I'm particularly interested in graphics,
virtual reality, programming language development, functional programming and
pure mathematics. I'm currently working at Unity, on the light transport team.
Check out [my stuff](https://github.com/pema99), if you want, and feel free to reach
out on any socials.

I also run a [blog](archive.md) and host my [personal notes](https://pema.dev/obsidian/math/light-transport/the-rendering-equation.html) on this domain.

# Currently working on
- This website.
- A path tracer, [rust-path-tracer](https://github.com/pema99/rust-path-tracer).

# Noteworthy projects
- [rust-path-tracer](https://github.com/pema99/rust-path-tracer), a GPU accelerated path tracer written entirely in Rust.
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/pema99/Raytracer), an older but fairly fleshed out CPU-based path tracer.
- [LotusNES](https://github.com/pema99/LotusNES), an NES emulator written in C#. It runs Battletoads!
- [Bonk](https://github.com/pema99/bonk), my functional ML-like toy language.
- [Shader Knowledge](https://github.com/pema99/shader-knowledge), where I share VRChat specific shader trickery.
- [glsl2hlsl](https://pema99.github.io/glsl2hlsl), a tool for converting ShaderToy shaders to working Unity shaders.
- [Shaderception](https://github.com/pema99/Shaderception), a shader compiler and runtime that runs entirely within VRChat.
- [A bunch of small stuff on ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/pema99)
- [An ISPC backend for the Futhark language](https://futhark-lang.org/student-projects/ispc-bsc-thesis.pdf)
